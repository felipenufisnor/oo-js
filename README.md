JavaScript: object-oriented programming

In this project I was able to observe the main concepts of object orientation;
I understood how JavaScript handles OO through functions and prototypes;
I checked the principles of class, object, and heritance;
I discovered what encapsulation is and why it is important; Finally, I understood the polymorphism with some examples and I analyzed my code according to SOLID standards.
